# Inception

The **Inception** Project is a sophisticated web infrastructure, all running on the same Docker network, orchestrated using Docker and Docker Compose. NGINX manages incoming web traffic, serving static files directly and forwarding dynamic content requests to PHP-FPM, which processes PHP code from WordPress. WordPress uses Redis for caching frequently accessed data, enhancing performance by reducing database queries to MariaDB, which handles all content data storage and management. After PHP-FPM processes the request and retrieves data from Redis and MariaDB, the content is returned to NGINX for delivery to the user. Additionally, NGINX serves a static website for direct content delivery. Adminer provides database management for MariaDB, and Portainer oversees and monitors the Docker containers running these services. Docker volumes ensure persistent storage and efficient data management, all within a unified Docker network that facilitates seamless communication and operation across the entire system.


## Key Components and Their Roles

| Component                | Role                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **NGINX**                | Acts as the web server and reverse proxy, handling incoming web requests efficiently. Serves static content and forwards dynamic content requests to PHP-FPM. Optimizes web performance and ensures secure connections through SSL/TLS configuration. |
| **WordPress with PHP-FPM** | Forms the core of the dynamic content management system (CMS). PHP-FPM processes PHP scripts, enabling WordPress to generate dynamic web pages based on user interactions, templates, and plugins. Essential for serving personalized content to users. |
| **MariaDB**              | Serves as the relational database management system (RDBMS) for WordPress. Stores all structured data generated by WordPress, including posts, pages, comments, and settings. Ensures data persistence and integrity. |
| **Redis**                | Acts as an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. Enhances WordPress performance by caching frequently accessed data, reducing load times, and improving the overall user experience. |
| **Static Website**       | Represents a simple website hosted alongside the WordPress site. Demonstrates the capability to serve static content efficiently, showcasing the versatility of the NGINX server in handling different types of web content. |
| **Portainer**            | Provides a graphical interface for managing Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes. Simplifies the administration of the Docker environment, making it easier to monitor and manage the infrastructure components. |
| **Adminer**              | Introduces a web interface for database management, supporting operations such as viewing and editing databases, tables, and records. Complements MariaDB by providing an accessible way to interact with the database directly from a web browser. |

## Interconnectivity and Configuration

The components of the Inception project are interconnected and managed through Docker Compose, which facilitates the setup and orchestration of the multi-container application. Here’s a breakdown of how the various services are configured to work together:

1. **Custom Network**:
   - A custom Docker network named `inception` is created to enable seamless communication between all containers. This network ensures that services can find and communicate with each other using their container names as hostnames.

2. **NGINX**:
   - NGINX acts as the entry point for incoming web requests. It listens on specified ports (HTTPS port 443) and directs traffic based on its configuration.
   - It serves static content directly and forwards requests for dynamic content to PHP-FPM, which processes PHP scripts.
   - NGINX communicates with WordPress and PHP-FPM using the internal Docker network.

3. **WordPress with PHP-FPM**:
   - WordPress runs as a PHP application server, processing dynamic content with the help of PHP-FPM.
   - It connects to MariaDB for database operations, storing and retrieving data as needed.
   - PHP-FPM is configured to work with NGINX, which passes PHP requests to it for processing.

4. **MariaDB**:
   - MariaDB acts as the relational database management system for WordPress.
   - It stores all the structured data required by WordPress and is accessed by WordPress over the Docker network.
   - MariaDB is configured with persistent storage to ensure data persistence across container restarts.

5. **Redis**:
   - Redis is used as an in-memory cache to improve the performance of WordPress.
   - It stores frequently accessed data and serves it quickly to reduce load times.
   - WordPress is configured to use Redis for caching, enhancing the overall user experience.

6. **Static Website**:
   - A simple static website is served alongside the WordPress site to demonstrate NGINX’s capability to handle different types of content.
   - This static site is hosted on the same NGINX server but served from a different location or virtual host configuration.

7. **Portainer**:
   - Portainer provides a web-based graphical interface for managing Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes.
   - It is connected to the Docker engine and provides an easy way to monitor and manage the infrastructure components.

8. **Adminer**:
   - Adminer is a web-based database management tool that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with MariaDB.
   - It is accessible through NGINX, allowing users to view and manage databases, tables, and records directly from a web browser.

Each component is configured to communicate through the `inception` network, ensuring a cohesive and functional web infrastructure. Docker Compose handles the orchestration, including the creation of networks, volumes, and service dependencies, simplifying the setup and management of the project.
