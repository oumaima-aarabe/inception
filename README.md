###
The **Inception** Project is a sophisticated web infrastructure, all running on the same Docker network, orchestrated using <span style="color: teal;">Docker</span> and <span style="color: teal;">Docker Compose</span>. <span style="color: purple;">NGINX</span> manages incoming web traffic, serving static files directly and forwarding dynamic content requests to <span style="color: purple;">PHP-FPM</span>, which processes PHP code from <span style="color: purple;">WordPress</span>. <span style="color: purple;">WordPress</span> uses <span style="color: purple;">Redis</span> for caching frequently accessed data, enhancing performance by reducing database queries to <span style="color: purple;">MariaDB</span>, which handles all content data storage and management. After <span style="color: purple;"><span style="color: purple;">PHP-FPM</span></span> processes the request and retrieves data from <span style="color: purple;">Redis</span> and <span style="color: purple;">MariaDB</span>, the content is returned to <span style="color: purple;">NGINX</span> for delivery to the user. Additionally, <span style="color: purple;">NGINX</span> serves a <span style="color: purple;">Static Website</span> for direct content delivery. <span style="color: purple;">Adminer</span> provides database management for <span style="color: purple;">MariaDB</span>, and <span style="color: purple;">Portainer</span> oversees and monitors the <span style="color: teal;">Docker</span> containers running these services. <span style="color: teal;">Docker</span> volumes ensure persistent storage and efficient data management, all within a unified <span style="color: teal;">Docker</span> network that facilitates seamless communication and operation across the entire system.



## <span style="color: lightblue">Key Components and Their Roles

The components of the <span style="color: lightblue">Inception</span> project are interconnected and managed through <span style="color: teal">Docker  Compose</span>, which facilitates the setup and orchestration of the multi-container application. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the various services are configured to work together:

| Component                | Role                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **<span style="color: purple;">NGINX</span>**                | Acts as the web server and reverse proxy, handling incoming web requests efficiently. Serves static content and forwards dynamic content requests to <span style="color: purple;">PHP-FPM</span>. Optimizes web performance and ensures secure connections through SSL/TLS configuration. |
| **<span style="color: purple;">WordPress</span> with <span style="color: purple;">PHP-FPM</span>** | Forms the core of the dynamic content management system (CMS). <span style="color: purple;">PHP-FPM</span> processes PHP scripts, enabling <span style="color: purple;">WordPress</span> to generate dynamic web pages based on user interactions, templates, and plugins. Essential for serving personalized content to users. |
| **<span style="color: purple;">MariaDB</span>**              | Serves as the relational database management system (RDBMS) for <span style="color: purple;">WordPress</span>. Stores all structured data generated by <span style="color: purple;">WordPress</span>, including posts, pages, comments, and settings. Ensures data persistence and integrity. |
| **<span style="color: purple;">Redis</span>**                | Acts as an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. Enhances <span style="color: purple;">WordPress</span> performance by caching frequently accessed data, reducing load times, and improving the overall user experience. |
| **<span style="color: purple;">Static Website</span>**       | Represents a simple website hosted alongside the <span style="color: purple;">WordPress</span> site. Demonstrates the capability to serve static content efficiently, showcasing the versatility of the <span style="color: purple;">NGINX</span> server in handling different types of web content. |
| **<span style="color: purple;">Portainer</span>**            | Provides a graphical interface for managing <span style="color: teal">Docker</span> containers, images, networks, and volumes. Simplifies the administration of the <span style="color: teal">Docker</span> environment, making it easier to monitor and manage the infrastructure components. |
| **<span style="color: purple;">Adminer</span>**              | Introduces a web interface for database management, supporting operations such as viewing and editing databases, tables, and records. Complements <span style="color: purple;">MariaDB</span> by providing an accessible way to interact with the database directly from a web browser. |


- A custom <span style="color: teal">Docker</span> network named `inception` is created to enable seamless communication between all containers. This network ensures that services can find and communicate with each other using their container names as hostnames.

- Each component is configured to communicate through the `inception` network, ensuring a cohesive and functional web infrastructure. <span style="color: teal">Docker</span> Compose handles the orchestration, including the creation of networks, volumes, and service dependencies, simplifying the setup and management of the project.
